# Business Introduction
In today’s highly competitive global market, efficient supply chain management has become a critical determinant of business success. Organizations must balance customer satisfaction, cost efficiency, and operational agility to remain competitive. This analysis explores the operational dynamics within a global supply chain dataset, with the goal of uncovering insights that drive data-driven decision-making.

The dataset represents end-to-end order transactions — covering customer details, product categories, regional sales, shipping modes, profit margins, and delivery performance. By leveraging advanced analytics using SQL and visualization tools, this project examines key supply chain performance indicators such as delivery timeliness, profitability by product and region, and demand patterns across time.

The purpose of this analysis is to identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and opportunities for optimization in logistics and operations. Insights from this study will help stakeholders:

Improve delivery reliability and reduce late shipments

Enhance inventory and demand forecasting accuracy

Increase profit margins through better pricing and sourcing decisions

Strengthen customer satisfaction and retention
