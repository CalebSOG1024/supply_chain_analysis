# Global_supply_chain_analysis_ using_MySQL

# Description
This project analyzes a global supply chain dataset to uncover insights about delivery performance, regional sales, product profitability, and demand trends. The goal is to identify operational inefficiencies and recommend strategies for improving logistics, profitability, and customer satisfaction. 

# Business Introduction
In today’s highly competitive global market, efficient supply chain management has become a critical determinant of business success. Organizations must balance customer satisfaction, cost efficiency, and operational agility to remain competitive. This analysis explores the operational dynamics within a global supply chain dataset, with the goal of uncovering insights that drive data-driven decision-making.

The dataset represents end-to-end order transactions — covering customer details, product categories, regional sales, shipping modes, profit margins, and delivery performance. By leveraging advanced analytics using SQL and visualization tools, this project examines key supply chain performance indicators such as delivery timeliness, profitability by product and region, and demand patterns across time.

# Business Problem
In today’s fast-paced and competitive global market, businesses rely on their supply chain performance to sustain profitability, ensure customer satisfaction, and maintain a competitive edge. However, inefficiencies within supply chain operations — such as late deliveries, unbalanced inventory levels, and uneven profit margins across regions and products — can lead to significant financial losses, reduced customer loyalty, and operational bottlenecks.

The organization in focus manages a diverse portfolio of products distributed across multiple regions through different shipping modes. Despite having access to vast amounts of operational data, the company lacks clear visibility into the performance drivers affecting its supply chain efficiency. Issues such as delayed shipments, high logistics costs, poor demand forecasting, and inconsistent regional performance have created barriers to achieving optimal business outcomes.

These challenges manifest in several key areas:
* Delivery Performance Issues: A notable portion of orders are being delivered late, negatively impacting customer experience and increasing return rates.

* Profitability Imbalance: Some products generate high sales but deliver minimal profit margins, indicating inefficiencies in pricing or sourcing strategies.

* Regional Disparities: Certain regions outperform others significantly in terms of sales and profit, suggesting possible logistical or marketing gaps.

* Demand Seasonality: Fluctuations in demand without proper forecasting lead to stockouts during peak seasons and overstocking during low demand periods.

* Inefficient Shipping Modes: Shipping methods vary widely in speed and cost-effectiveness, affecting delivery consistency and overall fulfillment costs.

Without a data-driven understanding of these underlying inefficiencies, strategic decision-making becomes reactive rather than proactive. Therefore, the central business problem is:

How can the company leverage supply chain data analytics to identify performance inefficiencies, optimize delivery operations, improve profitability, and enhance customer satisfaction across regions and product categories?

# Aim of this Project
The purpose of this analysis is to identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and opportunities for optimization in logistics and operations. Insights from this study will help stakeholders:

* Improve delivery reliability and reduce late shipments

* Enhance inventory and demand forecasting accuracy

* Increase profit margins through better pricing and sourcing decisions

Strengthen customer satisfaction and retention
